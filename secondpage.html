    <p1>
      I’m Axel De Jesus a 17 year old high school student. I hope to study computer science/accounting/firefighting and open a center for children who don’t have the best upbringing to be exposed to things they would have been otherwise. Throughout my time in highschool I have done a complete 180 with my goals in life. I spent a lot of time being very immature and not realizing how important my academics in highschool are to my future. I plan on continuing my education whether it be with software development, accounting, or even firefighting.
<br>
<br>I had no idea what I want to do in my life and still am in-between on what I want. Luckily I started creating goals for myself and for my future that gave me the motivation to be better. I’ve been keeping up with my goals since then. I work hard and know that the only person that has to be responsible for where I am in my life is myself. Because of that I am committed to fix my situation for myself and my family, help younger people who aren’t able to fix their own, and be as successful as I can.
